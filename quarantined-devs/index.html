The devs on the 'Quarantined Devs' Whatsapp group chat decided to have an AMA session (Ask Me Anything) and i volunteered to write a script 

to help keep track of the people who have had their session so we can keep tabs on the session flow.

Thansk to Akinwunmi Aguda for helping me out and Blessing for suggesting we have AMA sessions.
